# BPF kernel code

- `tcp_syn_kern.c` - Main program attached to a Hook Point and executed on every received packet
- `tcp_syn_kern.go` - Utility code to generate `*_bpfeb.*` and `*_bpfel.*` programs
- `tcp_syn_kern.h` - Headers for Main program `tcp_syn_kern.c`
- `*_bpfeb.*` - Autogenerated code 
- `*_bpfel.*` - Autogenerated code


The terms `bpfeb` and `bpfel` refer to the endianness of the BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) bytecode. 
BPF bytecode is a low-level representation of BPF programs that can be executed by the Linux kernel. 
The key difference between `bpfeb` and `bpfel` files lies in their endianness:
- `bpfeb` (Big-Endian): The BPF bytecode is stored in big-endian format. Big-endian places the most significant byte first (at the lowest memory address) and the least significant byte last (at the highest memory address).
- `bpfel` (Little-Endian): The BPF bytecode is stored in little-endian format. Little-endian places the least significant byte first (at the lowest memory address) and the most significant byte last (at the highest memory address).
